# AI-for-the-Industry-4.0
A company producing fiber optic sensors decided to implement the AI techniques to automate verification of produced sensors. Currently, after the production of the sensor, its characteristics should be verified each time in three reference substances in order to configure: Air, Water and Isopropanol. After the procedure in the laboratory they collected three spectroscopic signals. Unfortunately, such procedures are extremely time consuming and require large human resources. The main task in this project is to implement AI algorithms in order to predict characteristics of a working sensor in water and isopropanol based on measured characteristics in air. It will enable to reduce validation process only to measurements in the air.
